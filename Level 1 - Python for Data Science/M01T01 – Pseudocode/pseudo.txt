An algorithm that asks a user to enter a positive number repeatedly until the user enters a zero value, then determines and 
outputs the largest of the numbers that were entered.

# FIRST ATTEMPT
request user to enter any positive integer
while input does not equal zero:
	store inputs
if input equals zero:	
	return input of highest value

# In words, I need to define a function to continually request the user to enter a positive integer value, or they can enter zero if they want to show the highest number they previously entered. I have decided to try to write a function instead and treat it like a game. This is actually like a counter for a high score kept until the player loses. I see that the logic needs to be different. I started with user interaction/what should display on the screen first, without the code to back it. 

# I read on BuiltIn's website: "pseudocode is the ability to represent six programming constructs (always written in uppercase): SEQUENCE, CASE, WHILE, REPEAT-UNTIL, FOR, and IF-THEN-ELSE". I read about this and it is very helpful to know. 

# I looked at PAL's "Pseudocode 101" examples. My code below uses some words from page 2. They use the words like "get" and "display" that I will use as well as Riaan's provided lines. I also recall now learning years ago that ! means "not".

# My friend Petrus pointed out that I did not define max before calling it. I placed it here and made it one million instead of infinity (∞). This is because in the game I am thinking of, no one could get that score.

# SECOND ATTEMPT
Define function high_score:
	max = 1000000 
	GET (first) input = "Enter any positive number or press zero to end the game." # This must be set up to repeat
		WHILE input != 0 DO:  # It seems Riaan's WHILE loop here does this. This is the same as REPEAT-UNTIL.
			IF input > max THEN set max = (new) input # Also code from Riaan. Now using IF-THEN-ELSE logic. 
			ELSE display max
RUN high_score


* This means that if the input is more than (>) the previous maximum value, then overwrite the old maximum with the new one!

An algorithm that requests a user to input their name and then stores their name in a variable called first_name. 
Subsequently, the algorithm should print out first_name along with the phrase “Hello, World”

# FIRST ATTEMPT
request user to enter their first name
store input as first_name
return first_name and "Hello, World"

# SECOND ATTEMPT
Define function greeting:
	GET first_name = "Please tell us your first name."  # This would be the START
		WHILE first_name ! = an alphabetic entry DO:
			IF first_name = "Please use only letters of the alphabet." 
			ELSE display first_name + "Hello, World!" # STOP 
RUN greeting

An algorithm that reads an arbitrary number of integers and then returns their arithmetic average.

# FIRST ATTEMPT
inspect all integers 
add values of all integers together
divide sum by 2 and store as average
return average 

# FOR command is needed, which D. Motiso on Indeed writes: "shows a repeating action or a loop. You use the FOR construct to apply instructions in an algorithm to every item in a data set." So FOR is used with maths equations. My answer is modelled on Sefa_Kurtuldu's from StackOverflow although I decided to write it in a way that makes more sense to me.

# SECOND ATTEMPT
Define function arithmetic_average(numbers):
	dividend = 0 and divisor = 0  # names from Wikipedia
	FOR int in numbers:    
		dividend + int = dividend
		divisor + 1 = divisor 
	dividend / divisor = quotient
	display quotient

RUN arithmetic_average()

An algorithm that reads a grocery list and prints out the products (in alphabetical order) that are still left to buy.

# FIRST ATTEMPT
inspect items on grocerylist
if item on grocerylist is ticked off:

else:
	sort all items on grocerylist from a to z
