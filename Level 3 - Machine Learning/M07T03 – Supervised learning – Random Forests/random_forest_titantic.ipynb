    "This Jupyter notebook explores the use of various random forest models in predicting the survival of passengers in the sinking of the Titanic, a well-known maritime disaster that occurred in 1912. The dataset contains information on demographic and ticket details, which can be contributing factors influencing survival. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, I am concerned with demonstrating the particular machine learning process, fine-tuning random forest, bagged and boosted models, and finding the most accurate and efficient option. The notebook includes data preparation, model training, and evaluation of model accuracy, providing an overview of the modelling process. \n",
    "\n",
    "A basic random forest is first produced with default settings and the features that contribute most to predicting whether a passenger survives or not are identified. The modelling process is then run again with different n_estimator (number of trees in the model) and max_depth (maximum depth of each tree) parameters and the accuracy of different iterations is evaluated. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the last two sections, the process is repeated with the ensemble methods known as bagged and boosted tree models and the model performance is assessed. "
